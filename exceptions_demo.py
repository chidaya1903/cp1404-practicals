# Questions (answers in comments):
# 1) When will a ValueError occur?
#    -> When the user enters something that cannot be converted to an integer
#       for numerator or denominator (e.g., letters, blank, 3.5).
# 2) When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
#    -> When the denominator is 0 at the moment of performing the division
#       (e.g., numerator / 0), if we donâ€™t guard against it.
# 3) Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?
#    -> Yes. Validate the denominator and re-prompt until it is not zero
#       (while denominator == 0: ask again), or catch ZeroDivisionError and ask again
#       before attempting the division. Implemented above with a simple loop.
